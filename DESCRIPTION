Description: Radiomic-based principal direction of mediation (radPDM) is a downstream radiomics analysis method that uses high dimensional mediation to explore the causal pathway between an exposure and an outcome through a radiomic mediator. The goal of radPDM is to provide a method to perform mediation analysis on radiomic data where p >> n. The overall objective is to find groups of radiomic features that mediate the effect of an exposure, specifically a gene, on a phenotype of interest.
