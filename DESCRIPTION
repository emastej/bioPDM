Description: Biological data principal direction of mediation (bioPDM) is a downstream -omic data analysis method that uses high dimensional mediation to explore the causal pathway between an exposure and an outcome through a multivariate mediator. The goal of bioPDM is to provide a method to perform mediation analysis on multivariate biological data where p >> n. The overall objective is to find groups of biological features that mediate the effect of an exposure on a phenotype of interest.
